            hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so
            they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day
            and become more active at night when it is cooler.

          The hippopotamus, also called the hippo, common hippopotamus, or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal and ungulate which is mostly herbivorous and native to sub-Saharan Africa. 
          It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus.
          Hippopotamuses love water, which is why the Greeks named them the “river horse.” Hippos spend up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool under the hot African sun. 
          Hippos are graceful in water, good swimmers, and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. 
          However, they are often large enough to simply walk or stand on the lake floor, or lie in the shallows.

          They have a gray coat and a black mane as well as a beard that can be black or white. There are several races of wildebeest. 
          The species forming the large herds of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania is known as the western white-bearded wildebeest, while the eastern white-bearded races inhabit Kenya and Tanzania east of the Gregory Rift.

          The Nile crocodile is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa, where it is present in 26 countries. 
          Nile crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus, were responsible for at least 480 attacks on people and 123 fatalities in Africa between 2010 and 2014. They are generalist predators and eat a wide variety of prey.
          The iconic crocodile found in Africa, the Nile crocodile is the second largest crocodile in the world, reaching a typical adult length of 4.5 metres (14.7 feet). The Nile crocodile is quite widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile Basin, and Madagascar in rivers, freshwater marshes, and mangrove swamps of Kenya and East Africa.
          The largest Nile crocodile ever officially recorded was a massive 21 feet and 2 inches long. The male crocodile was killed by the Duke of Mecklenburg in Tanzania in 1905 and weighed between 2,300 and 2,400 pounds.

          A venomous viper species found in savannah and grasslands from Morocco and western Arabia throughout Africa and Kenya except for the Sahara and rainforest regions.
          Venom yield is typically 150–350 mg, with a maximum of 750 mg. Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of 180–750 mg. About 100 mg are thought to be enough to kill a healthy adult human male, with death occurring after 25 hours. 
          In humans, bites from this species can produce severe local and systemic symptoms.
          Causing severe pain, swelling, blistering and in many cases severe tissue damage. Polyvalent antivenom is effective and should be administered sooner rather than later. Fatalities are quite rare.

        <p>
          The black mamba is a species of highly venomous snake belonging to the family Elapidae. It is native to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. First formally described by Albert Günther in 1864, it is the second-longest venomous snake after the king cobra; mature specimens generally exceed 2 m and commonly grow to 3 m.
          Stories of black mambas that chase and attack humans are common, but in fact the snakes generally avoid contact with humans. Most apparent cases of pursuit probably are examples of where witnesses have mistaken the snake's attempt to retreat to its lair when a human happens to be in the way.
          Since mambas are also able to swim, they can move smoothly and easily in the water, too. Though green mambas spend more time up in trees, black mambas do occasionally climb trees and have been known to drop on their predators if they feel threatened.

          A boomslang is a slender snake with large eyes on a large blunt head that is distinct from the neck. The snake can grow to up to 2 meters long, but is on average about 1 to 1.6 m in length. The large eyes of the snake are characteristic of the species.
          Known to reside high in trees, these elusive reptiles can cause some serious damage to the human body with its venom, preventing blood clots and leading to internal bleeding.
          it disables the coagulation process and the victim may die as a result of internal and external bleeding. The venom has been observed to cause hemorrhaging into tissues such as muscle and the brain.

          Four species of cobra reside in Kenya, including spitting cobras. The most menacing of the species is the Large Brown Spitting Cobra, known to grow 15ft in length.
          Their venom is not the most potent among venomous snakes, but the amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite—up to two-tenths of a fluid ounce—is enough to kill 20 people, or even an elephant. 
          King cobra venom affects the respiratory centers in the brain, causing respiratory arrest and cardiac failure.
          King cobras are impressively venomous, large snakes. They are called king cobras because they can kill and eat cobras.

          A large tropical sea fish that eats other fish.
          They are esteemed as sport fishes, and the smaller forms are also valued as food. In certain seas, however, they may become impregnated with a toxic substance that produces a form of poisoning known as ciguatera. Barracudas are often regarded as bold and inquisitive, and large ones are regarded as fearsome fishes, potentially dangerous to humans.

The Thunnini comprise 15 species across five genera, the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the bullet tuna up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which averages 2 m and is believed to live up to 50 years.
          tuna is a healthful food rich in protein and contains many vitamins and minerals such as B-Complex vitamins, Vitamins A and D as well as iron, selenium and phosphorus. Tuna also contains healthy omega 3 essential fatty acids DHA and EPA.
          The natural oils of these fish are full of Omega-3 fatty acids like DHA, which are essential for brain health. Eating salmon, tuna, and other fatty fish has been shown to stimulate brain cell growth.

        <p>
          The brown trout is a European species of salmonid fish that has been widely introduced into suitable environments globally.
          Rainbow Trout have small back spots and they will be present on the entire tail. Brown Trout usually don't have spots on the tail and if they do it won't cover their entire tail.
          Brown trout tend to grow bigger, live longer, and tolerate a wider range of habitat types than either brook trout or rainbow trout. Fishermen consider them to be among the smartest, most difficult trout species to catch.

        <p>
          Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: the Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and the mountain zebra. 
          Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae.
          They are black with white stripes. At first glance, it may appear the opposite is true—after all, the black stripes of many zebras end on the belly and towards the inside of the legs, revealing the rest as white.

        <p>
          The giraffe is a tall African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
          Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
          They have three hearts, to be exact. There is a systemic (main) heart. Two lesser hearts pump blood to the gills where waste is discarded and oxygen is received. They work like the right side of the human heart.

        <p>
          These small gazelles, named for researcher Joseph Thomson, have light-brown coats with dark stripes running down their sides, a white patch on their rumps extending underneath the tail, and ridged horns that curve backward.
          Thomson's gazelle is one of the best-known gazelles. 
          It is named after explorer Joseph Thomson and is sometimes referred to as a "tommie".
          The population estimate is around 550,000.
          Females may have shorter, smoother, and slimmer horns than males or none at all. Grant’s gazelles are sometimes confused with Thomson’s. 
          However, Thomson’s is distinguished from Grant’s by its smaller size and the white patch on its rump.

          The blue monkey or diademed monkey is a species of Old World monkey native to Central and East Africa, ranging from the upper Congo River basin east to the East African Rift and south to northern Angola and Zambia. 
          It sometimes includes Sykes', silver, and golden monkeys as subspecies.
          This species is so called due to the bluish coloration of its face. Blue monkey is otherwise called 'Diademed monkey", referring to a diadem-like, whitish or yellowish marking on its forehead.
          eating mainly fruits and leaves. In addition, blue monkeys tend to concentrate their invetebrate feeding on slow-moving slugs and worms (Rudran, 1978).

        <p>
          Black-and-white colobuses are Old World monkeys of the genus Colobus, native to Africa. They are closely related to the red colobus monkeys of genus Piliocolobus. 
          There are five species of this monkey, and at least eight subspecies. 
          A troop of colobus monkeys spend lots of time sleeping or sunning in trees, their long white tails dangling below. With a laid-back lifestyle like this, they are among the least aggressive of all primates.
          The colobus is the most arboreal of all African monkeys. These monkeys rarely descend to the ground. · They live in territorial troops.

        <h2 class="animate-charcter">Cheetah</h2>
        <p>
          The cheetah is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h, and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.
          It is a well-recorded fact that Cheetahs are docile animals and do not pose a threat to humans. These beautiful cats are shy and will avoid direct contact with humans.
          Although cheetahs are members of the cat family, they have dog-like non-retractable claws. This limits cheetahs tree-climbing ability but gives them a speed advantage when charging.

        <h2 class="animate-charcter">Pink Flamingo</h2>
        <p>
          Flamingos usually stand on one leg with the other tucked beneath the body. The reason for this behaviour is not fully understood. One theory is that standing on one leg allows the birds to conserve more body heat, given that they spend a significant amount of time wading in cold water.
          Flamingos filter-feed on brine shrimp and blue-green algae as well as insect larvae, small insects, mollusks and crustaceans making them omnivores. Their bills are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat, and are uniquely used upside-down. 
          Flamingos are very social birds; they live in colonies whose population can number in the thousands. These large colonies are believed to serve three purposes for the flamingos: avoiding predators, maximizing food intake, and using scarce suitable nesting sites more efficiently.
