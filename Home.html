          <p>
            Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20
            hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so
            they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day
            and become more active at night when it is cooler.

          <p>
            Portrayed as the most seldom seen, leopards are actually the most
            widely distributed African big cat. They can be found in a variety
            of habitats ranging from desert country to equatorial forests, high
            mountains to coasts. Few can also be spotted on the outskirts of
            large cities like Pretoria, Harare and Nairobi.

          <p>
            These brilliant beasts are known for their awesome, giant horns that
            grow from their snouts – hence the name “rhinoceros’, meaning “nose
            horn”. Javan and Indian rhinos have one horn, where as the white,
            black and Sumatran rhinos have two.

            Buffalos are extremely social and live in large, mixed herds of up
            to 2000 members! Both sexes have a separate hierarchy, with males
            dominant over females. Members of the same subgroup will stay in
            direct contact with each other and will often sleep with their heads
            resting on one another.
