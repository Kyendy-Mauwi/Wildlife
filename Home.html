          <p>
            Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20
            hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so
            they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day
            and become more active at night when it is cooler.

            Portrayed as the most seldom seen, leopards are actually the most
            widely distributed African big cat. They can be found in a variety
            of habitats ranging from desert country to equatorial forests, high
            mountains to coasts. Few can also be spotted on the outskirts of
            large cities like Pretoria, Harare and Nairobi.

          <p>
            Buffalos are extremely social and live in large, mixed herds of up
            to 2000 members! Both sexes have a separate hierarchy, with males
            dominant over females. Members of the same subgroup will stay in
            direct contact with each other and will often sleep with their heads
            resting on one another.

        <h2 class="animate-charcter">Hippopotamus</h2>
        <p>
          The hippopotamus, also called the hippo, common hippopotamus, or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal and ungulate which is mostly herbivorous and native to sub-Saharan Africa. 
          It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus.
          Hippopotamuses love water, which is why the Greeks named them the ‚Äúriver horse.‚Äù Hippos spend up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool under the hot African sun. 
          Hippos are graceful in water, good swimmers, and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. 
          However, they are often large enough to simply walk or stand on the lake floor, or lie in the shallows.

        <p>
          Also known as the gnu, the wildebeest is a member of the antelope family. They have a large, box-like head with curving horns. 
          The front end of their body is heavily built, while the hindquarters are slender with spindly legs. 
          They have a gray coat and a black mane as well as a beard that can be black or white. There are several races of wildebeest. 
          The species forming the large herds of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania is known as the western white-bearded wildebeest, while the eastern white-bearded races inhabit Kenya and Tanzania east of the Gregory Rift. 
          The brindled, or blue, race occurs south of the Zambezi River.
